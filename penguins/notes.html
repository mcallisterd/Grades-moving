The orange line through the middle of the graph
is horizontal, at the grade that that particular
penguin had as an average at the end of the course.
The area above and below the line is color coded
to show how the penguin was doing at the time
relative to their final grade.
<br/>
You can use the Y Zoom button to zoom in the visualization
vertically to show a more close-up version of
the same data, making small changes potentially more
obvious.
<br/>
To zoom in the x, give a starting x value and an
ending x value, and we display the graph just over
that range of x values, also zooming in the y.
If you like weird geometric stuff, put the values
in backwards, e.g. 40 in the first box and 0 in the
second.
<br/>
The pictures of penguins on the side are the way
to navigate between different students, you can
click on a penguin's picture to see their grades.
